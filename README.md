# Maeda Path

This is a bot for maeda path, a flash game. 
This game is similar to [wire loop game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_loop_game). 
I used `OpenCV`, `gstreamer` to read the screen and `X11` to read keyboard input and move the mouse. 
If you want to use it yourself, you probably have to adjust the `crop_rect` rectangle. 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=011XWQINEY8) is a demonstration.
